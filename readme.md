### Week 4 Assignment for DTU course 02160

##### Explanation of code

The fundamental code was recycled from week1. There are 4 classes, the main method taking place in the 'Checkers' class. The board.class contains the playing board, and the move.class altered the position of the player pieces given input from the userinput class. 

###### Design frustrations

Initially I wanted to mix some new code while re-using old code however, things became messier with the more objects I tried to implement using 'SOLID' programming. Then once time pressure kicked in. I had to unfortunately fall back on the old code and produced this, which hasn't really taken the best approach to the game (object oriented wise)..
